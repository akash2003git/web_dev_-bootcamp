        <p>The cat (Felis catus), commonly referred to as the domestic cat or house cat, is a small domesticated
            carnivorous mammal. It is the only domesticated species of the family <a href="#nowhere">Felidae</a>. Recent advances in
            archaeology
            and genetics
            have shown that the domestication of the cat occurred in the Near East around 7500 BC. It is commonly kept
            as a
            house pet and farm cat, but also ranges freely as a feral cat avoiding human contact. Valued by humans for
            companionship and its ability to kill vermin, the cat's retractable claws are adapted to killing small prey
            like
            mice and rats. It has a strong, flexible body, quick reflexes, and sharp teeth, and its night vision and
            sense
            of smell are well developed. It is a social species, but a solitary hunter and a crepuscular predator. Cat
            communication includes vocalizations like meowing, purring, trilling, hissing, growling, and grunting as
            well as
            cat body language. It can hear sounds too faint or too high in frequency for human ears, such as those made
            by
            small mammals. It secretes and perceives pheromones. </p>

        <p>Female domestic cats can have kittens from spring to late autumn in temperate zones and throughout the year
            in
            equatorial regions, with litter sizes often ranging from two to five kittens. Domestic cats are bred and
            shown
            at events as registered pedigreed cats, a hobby known as cat fancy. Animal population control of cats may be
            achieved by spaying and neutering, but their proliferation and the abandonment of pets has resulted in large
            numbers of feral cats worldwide, contributing to the extinction of bird, mammal, and reptile species. </p>

        <h2>Etymology and naming</h2>

        <p>The origin of the English word cat, Old English catt, is thought to be the Late Latin word cattus, which was
            first used at the beginning of the 6th century.[4] The Late Latin word may be derived from an unidentified
            African language.[5] The Nubian word kaddîska 'wildcat' and Nobiin kadīs are possible sources or
            cognates.[6]
